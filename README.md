# Introduction

The NVAITC (NVIDIA AI Technology Centre) toolkit is a Python codebase that showcases the use of most relevant NVIDIA deep learning libraries (DALI, AMP, TensorRT) and Horovod, a framework for distributed training. The purpose of this project, which includes code snippets taken from other NVIDIA Deep Learning examples, i.e. https://github.com/NVIDIA/apex/blob/master/examples/imagenet/main_amp.py, https://github.com/NVIDIA/DALI/blob/master/docs/examples/use_cases/pytorch/resnet50/main.py, is to illustrate how to combine these libraries together for achieving better training and inference performance. The codebase might be subject to further changes as new versions of used libraries become available or new functionalities requested. It requests the availability of ImageNet to demonstrate how to train a network (ResNet50) against a well known dataset.
